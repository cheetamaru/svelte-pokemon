# Svelte Pokemon Pet Project

Pokemon list display using https://pokeapi.co/

## Goals:

1. Show my frontend architecture skills by creating a project using the framework I don't normally use
2. Implement virtual scrolling, examine different approaches of creating it
3. Explore accessibility features and their implementations
4. Have fun

## TODO List:

- [x] API layer (sort of)
- [ ] Item layout and design - in Progress
- [ ] Virtual Scrolling
- [ ] Adaptive layout
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Deployment

## Developing

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
