# Svelte Virtual Scrolling Pet Project

Pokemon list with virtual scrolling

API: https://pokeapi.co/

## Goals:

1. Show my frontend skills by creating a project using the framework I don't use
2. Implement virtual scrolling, examine different approaches of creating it
3. Have fun

## TODO List:

- [x] API layer (sort of)
- [x] Item layout and design
- [x] Virtual Scrolling
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Deployment

## To Refactor:

- [ ] import paths (?)
- [ ] `PokemonCardList.svelte`
- [ ] `VirtualScroll.svelte`
- [ ] tests


## Developing

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
